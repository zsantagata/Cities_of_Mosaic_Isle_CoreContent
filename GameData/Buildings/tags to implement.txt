buildingkind tags to implement:

road benefit: output increase vs radius increase/distance decrease (second one for kin or distribution calculations possibly) vs increase leader workplace count factor (a discount on how much this building contributes to leader's controlled workplaces)
provides: water vs mcal vs protein vs hstasis (quality proportion of range is after colon)
housing disease frequency factor
housing hstasis need decrease factor
flammable
houses: leaders vs wanderers vs delegations vs normal pops vs only certain races
worker happiness impact: value per worker (will be * workers in this building / total pops of the race before being fed into employment happiness)
worker danger factor

ignore worker skill
scale radius to max workers
