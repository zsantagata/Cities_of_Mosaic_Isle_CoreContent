	<mScriptCalledBetweenOutputCalculationAndResolution></mScriptCalledBetweenOutputCalculationAndResolution>  <!-- if this building is a workplace, this script is called when the building has produced a non-zero quantity/quality of output, but before it has resolved the output into service quality for surrounding buildings or a resource addition to the resource pool.  This script can also be called at other times by, for example, menus, to try to predict what a workplace's output is going to be, but such calls will always have the fourth input set to "true".  First input is the building, second is quantity (of actual resource, not internal calculation), third is quality (of actual resource/service, not internal calculation), fourth is a bool that indicates "are we calling this script solely for predictive purposes" which is false if input resources are being consumed and output is actually being produced, fifth is a Dictionary of IFResource,double which is used instead of the (double quantity) if and only if this building extracts goods from the land.  Return value is a List of objects of size 4 holding quantity/quality/prediction text/dictionary of IFResource,double (double/double/string/Dictionary&lt;IFResource,double&gt;) in that order, but the script can obviously keep the first two (and last dictionary) the same and do other things if necessary.  If prediction text is the empty string "", then default empty string logic takes over (goods/services autogenerated text), otherwise the prediction text is printed as is. -->
