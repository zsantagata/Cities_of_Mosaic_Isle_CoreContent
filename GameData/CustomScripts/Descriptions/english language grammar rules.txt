I call these grammar rules but grammar rules can't really be enforced, because something might be in quotes (as someone speaking) or for artistic effect.  So these are more like punctuation/character rules.  Order is not necessarily the order in which they are enforced.

-1) tab should become spaces, for consistency
0) carriage return should be ignored (\n is the newline character, \r is carriage return which is sometimes alongside it)
1) multiple spaces nowhere but after a period.
2) double spaces after a period.
3) ". is not right, it should be ."
4) ", is not right, it should be ,"
5) double or multiple commas are never right
6) double or multiple ! are ugly and not right
7) double or multiple ? are ugly and not right
8) mixed ? and ! next to each other should be one single ? 
9) If the first character after a period-double-space or a new line is a letter, it must be a capital letter
10) more than two newlines (\n) are ugly and not right
11) double period that is not part of an ellipses (...) should be changed to a single period
12) a comma and then a period should turn into just a period (,. -> .), as should a period then a comma (., -> .)
13) any number of multiple commas should become one comma
14) the word "a" should not be followed by a word with a vowel starting letter.  Instead, the word "a" should be transformed into "an" (okay this one is actually about vowel "sounds" rather than the letter but this is close enough)
15) possessive of a word ending in s should be just ', not 's (ex: Minotaurs's should be Minotaurs', but Hylidae's should stay as Hylidae's)
16) if the first non-space character of the string is a letter, it should be capitalized
17) a space and then a comma should be just a comma
18) a space and then a period should be just a period
