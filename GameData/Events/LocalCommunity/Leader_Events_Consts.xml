			<c>Hello, [0].  This is [1] Leader [2].  Don't worry, I have no ill intent.  The circumstances are, I need a few resources:\n[one_listofresources|no_qualities_list:0]\n\nWith that, I'll be able to better serve my [3].  They may not understand why it has to be this way, so I want you to get me those resources without letting any [4] know.  It shouldn't be too hard if you are competent, City Leader.  Though, if you fail to do so, it would become clear that you are not a competent [5] at all.  And I would certainly let the [6] know about your inept nature.\n\nI don't expect you to do me this favor for nothing in exchange.  If you're able to help me, and keep this discreet, I'll point out the better decisions you've made for the [6].  They will listen to me.  Far more than they will to you, so dismiss any brave ideas.\n\nWe never spoke.  Good night, [0].</c></i1>

It seems that the once-leader has chosen to leave the city entirely, no doubt as a result of this incident.  We, or the now exiled [1], must have been overheard in some way.

That is normal even in the best of times, but one of my [4], [7], is inflaming the situation with [one_pop|possessive_3ppronoun_adj_phrase:[5]] lies.  [one_pop|personal_3ppronoun_phrase:[5]] may try to usurp my position, and I intend not to let this infighting succeed.\n\nIf [7] becomes unable to mislead the [1] community, I would have more appreciation for your leadership.
